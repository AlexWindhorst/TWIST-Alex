The primary learning objective of this TWIST project was to take what knowledge we learned about Express and convert it into a functional website that would allow registration for TWIST and the ability for an admin to create various schedules with said information.</br>

I contributed to the project by assisting with the creation of the back-end programming. I worked on the controllers, mainly the session controller, as well as the models. I also helped create a few of the forms on the dashboard. In the models, I primarily worked on adding the schemas.</br>

There were quite a few issues we ran into during this project. One of the most significant problems was the lack of organization and time. During the early stages of the project, the only time we would get together as a group was during our studio. Until we started using Trello and GroupMe after Thanksgiving break, it wasn't very easy to determine what each person should work on. Another problem we faced during this project was lack of knowledge. The tutorials we went through in class thaught us the main concepts of Express, but taking that knowledge and applying it to a project with no concrete way of going about it was difficult.</br>

Some features that would need more time to implement would include the edit functionality for our speakers and the ability to delete any information we stored. We also were not able to display any type of schedule for editing or printing.</br>

If I were giving the chance to start this project over, I would get organized as early as possible. I would also try to take more of an active role in the project instead of waiting on others to figure out who should work on what. I relied a lot on Jon and Eric's help during this project so, if I could start all over, I would take more of an independent approach to the work I completed. That's not to say I wouldn't work with the group; in fact, I would work more with the group than I did this time around and try to make more time to work together, if the other member's schedules allowed it.
